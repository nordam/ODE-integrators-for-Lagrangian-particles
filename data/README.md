# Example current data

These datafiles are provided as examples of modelled ocean current data, and will allow the user to reproduce the figures found in the accompanying paper by Nordam and Duran (2020?). To reduce the file size, these files have been trimmed to contain only the current velocity vectors for the surface layer, for five days. All other variable have been removed, and the horizontal extent has been reduced to cover only the region used for the simulations in the paper.

The files are adapted from original datafiles provided by the Norwegian Meteorological Institute (MET), at [thredds.met.no][https://thredds.met.no]. The original files cover larger spatial extents, and contain additional variables. For more details, see the original datasets.
